        // M2.4 Task 2 raised the floor from 133 to 179 (the full runnable set) by render-time WmlComparer-
        // compatible granularity (contiguous-region coalescing, word-boundary common-affix trim, zero-width

        // interior compat coarsening), WC-1750/1760 (table-aware block similarity + note-scope empty-mark
        // prune). Workstream D then closed WC-1900 (174) by making the Choice/Fallback textbox dedup robust to
        // NON-ADJACENT (nested) branch interleaving via content-signature occurrence parity — the oracle
        // MC-resolves AlternateContent to one branch (PreProcessMarkup, ProcessAllParts/Office2007), so it
        // counts one copy; the reader walks both for projection parity, and the dedup now mirrors the oracle
        // wherever the Fallback copy lands. M2.5 Task 3 then closed WC-1710/1720 (175→176) by giving the IR the
        // oracle's NOTE-STORE CORRESPONDENCE (notes pair by body-reference order + content, not raw w:id —
        // IrEditScriptBuilder.BuildOneStore) plus a structural-only affix-trim guard (a byte-identical del/ins

        // PASSES, no catalog entry:
        //   * WC-1170 (WC007-Longest-At-End: `Video provides.` → a 36-token paragraph): the 1×1 gap-residue
        //     aligner pairs the near-rewrite as Modified, then Myers credits the COINCIDENTAL `Video` (source
        //     `Video` vs the after-text's `Online Video`) as an Equal island, splitting one rewrite into 3.
        //   * WC-1950 (WC053-Text-in-cell: `from the beginning…` → `in accordance with the procedure…`): only
        //     coincidental function words (`the`/`of`/`each`) shared; Myers split the rewrite into 4.
        //   * WC-1190 (WC007-Moved-into-Table): the spurious 3rd revision was a zero-width Inserted over the
        //     EMPTY cell paragraph (a bare paragraph mark) the moved-into-table block left behind.
        // FIXES (render-time, WmlComparerCompatible only; Fine grain untouched — IrRevisionRenderer): (1) a
        // low-coverage coarsening — when a Modified pair's Equal+FormatChanged CONTENT-token coverage (larger
        // side) is below 0.67 AND the larger side has ≥8 content tokens (so a near-rewrite, not a short edit),
        // bridge the word-bearing Equal islands too and emit ONE del+ins (the affix trim still keeps any wholly
        // common edge); (2) an empty-paragraph-mark prune — a whole-block Insert/Delete of a paragraph with
        // ZERO content tokens surfaces no WmlComparer revision. The 0.67/≥8 thresholds were swept over the
        // corpus (stable plateau floor 0.55–0.72 × min 6–10); both fixes are size/coverage-gated so no passing
        // row regresses (verified: WC-1930's 3-token `designs that compleme` short edit stays fine-grained; the
        // standalone math/SmartArt/image block inserts WC-1320/1340/1350/1550 keep their revisions — only an
        // EMPTY-mark paragraph is pruned, not a math/image one).
        //
        // ---- Engine token-differ: coincidental sub-word matches / wider span attribution (TokenSpanGranularity).
        // WmlComparer's whole-document LCS reports the minimal changed phrase as ONE del + ONE ins; the IR
        // token differ (Myers over word tokens, per Modified pair) finds a coincidental interior token match
        // that splits the change into more revisions. The split is in the ENGINE'S edit script (the grain is
        // untouchable); render-time coalescing merges separator-bridged regions and (M2.4b) low-coverage
        // near-rewrites, but cannot UN-match a genuine equal token inside a HIGH-coverage in-place edit without
        // re-running the diff at a coarser grain — and coarsening THOSE would UNDER-report (regress WC-1930).
        // The residual rows below are all high-coverage edits or adjacent-block-coalescing/structural cases that
        // the low-coverage coarsening deliberately does NOT touch.
        // ---- M2.4b Workstream C CLOSED five more rows via render-time adjacent-block insert/delete
        // COALESCING (IrRevisionRenderer.RenderBlockOpList) — now genuine PASSES, no catalog entry:
        //   * WC-1210 (Para-before-table): the `Abcde` | empty-table | `fghij` insert run coalesces with the
        //     table as a sub-region START boundary, giving ins `Abcde` + ins `<table>\nfghij` = 2 (+ the del) = 3.
        //   * WC-1420/1430 (Math-heavy paragraph): the math/run-boundary InsertBlock fragments that previously
        //     surfaced one-per-block now coalesce into the adjacent text region, recovering WmlComparer's count.
        //   * WC-1440 (Image+math+para): the two CONSECUTIVE inserted body paragraphs (`Jean-Antoine…` +
        //     `Watteau…` + the math-only para) coalesce into ONE Inserted region; `End` stays separate (Equal
        //     blocks bound it). 10 == 10.
        //   * WC-1840 (Table-5 cell): the cell's `Video.` + math-only + `Click` consecutive inserts coalesce to
        //     ONE region; del `Video. Click.` stays = 2.
        // The coalescing is GATED so WC-1550 (two STANDALONE math-only paragraph inserts, zero word content)
        // and WC-1320/1340/1350 (standalone image/SmartArt inserts) keep one revision per block — a sub-region
        // with NO Word token is left un-coalesced (those are what WmlComparer counts individually). Verified
        // zero regression on the math/image corpus rows.
        // ---- WC-1450 + WC-1830 (1:N sub-paragraph SPLIT): CLOSED in M2.6 (2026-06-12) — now genuine
        // PASSES, no catalog entry. Both fixtures' +1 was ONE before-paragraph whose content migrated across
        // TWO after-paragraphs inside a table cell (`Video provides…point. When you click…add.` split at the
        // sentence boundary, with an inserted math paragraph between the halves in WC-1830/cd11). M2.5 Task 2
        // PROVED this unfixable in the 1:1 IrEditOp model; M2.6 shipped the engine-level fix: SplitBlock/
        // MergeBlock op kinds (one singular anchor + N SplitMergeAnchors + per-segment partition-invariant
        // token diffs), a containment scan in the aligner's gap fill (IrBlockAligner.DetectOneToManyInGap —
        // in-order LCS coverage ≥ SplitCoverageThreshold, foreign slack ≤ SplitForeignSlack, zero-match edge
        // trim; after similarity pairing, before the 1×1 rule; may PROMOTE a same-gap Modified pairing whose
        // partner is one segment of the run), and renderer support (compat mode projects the oracle's account:
        // segment-0 inline edits + ONE coalesced Inserted spanning the split-off members — the oracle's
        // re-deleted tail coalesces into the adjacent deleted-paragraph region, so the split contributes
        // exactly one count). Spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-12-subparagraph-split-merge-design.md.
        // WC-1940 (WC052-SmartArt-Same vs -Mod): CLOSED in M2.4b Workstream A — now a genuine PASS (IR 2 ==
        // WmlComparer 2). The two spurious empty-text revisions were over UNCHANGED pure-SmartArt paragraphs
        // whose diagram drawing-object id (wp:docPr/@id, 1 vs 2) and diagram rel ids differed side-to-side,
        // so their opaque content hashes diverged and the aligner paired them del+ins. IrHasher.Canonicalize
        // now strips the renumber-prone wp:docPr/@id and resolves relationship attributes to stable
        // content-identity tokens (matching WmlComparer's CloneBlockLevelContentForHashing), so the unchanged
        // paragraphs hash equal and align as Equal. No catalog entry — the row PASSES.
        // WC-1950 (WC053-Text-in-cell): CLOSED in M2.4b Workstream B — now a genuine PASS (see the WS-B note
        // above). The cell rewrite shared only coincidental function words; the low-coverage coarsening
        // (max-side content coverage 0.41 < 0.67, 19 content tokens ≥ 8) collapses it to one del+ins.

        // ---- WC-1710/1720 + WC-1600/1620/1630 (WC034 footnote/endnote Before↔After3): CLOSED in M2.5 Task 3
        // — now GENUINE PASSES, no catalog entry. Two changes combined under the binding method rule:
        //   (1) NOTE-STORE CORRESPONDENCE (IrEditScriptBuilder.BuildOneStore): the IR no longer pairs notes by
        //       raw w:id. WmlComparer.ChangeFootnoteEndnoteReferencesToUniqueRange renumbers every note id in
        //       BODY-REFERENCE ORDER and ProcessFootnoteEndnote pairs a note with another note IFF their body
        //       references correlate Equal — so a note's correspondence is its body reference's, never the raw
        //       id. After3 relocates an endnote ref INTO the middle of `Video` (shifting ids: a new en#1 is
        //       inserted, Before's en#1 content moves to en#2). By-id pairing cross-matched unrelated notes and
        //       over-reported; the IR now collects each side's referenced note ids in body order and aligns them
        //       (exact-content LCS spine, then best-content-similarity residue with a forced lone-left/lone-right
        //       pair — the 1×1 rule), so Before-en#1 ↔ After3-en#2 (content modify) and After3-en#1/en#3 are
        //       whole-note inserts, matching the oracle. INVARIANT: when the reference sequences pair in order
        //       (no inserted/deleted ref shifted them — the common case), this reduces EXACTLY to by-id, so
        //       WC-1600/1660/1750/… are byte-identical (the prior trial that REGRESSED WC-1660/1670/1750/1760
        //       used unconstrained content similarity; the order-preserving spine + forced-1×1 residue is what
        //       keeps the single-edited-note case a modify rather than a del+ins).
        //   (2) STRUCTURAL-ONLY AFFIX-TRIM GUARD (IrRevisionRenderer region flush): the compat common-affix trim
        //       no longer cancels a del/ins region whose two sides are byte-IDENTICAL text. The token differ only
        //       emits such a region when the words differ in STRUCTURE (MatchKeys diverge though text matches) —
        //       the M2.5 Task 1 intra-word note-ref relocation (`Vi`⟨ref⟩`deo` vs `Video`, the relocated ref is
        //       textless). WmlComparer reports del `Video` + ins `Video` there; the old trim erased both to empty.
        // Together these recover the oracle's exact counts: WC-1620/1630 (footnotes, 3==3), WC-1710/1720
        // (endnotes, 7==7). No catalog entry — the rows PASS. (M2.5 Task 3 also closed WC-1920 — see its note
        // below — by aligning the affix-trim's word-boundary to WmlComparer's GetComparisonUnitList; ratchet 176→177.)

        // ---- Reader: textbox VML/DrawingML duplication NOT collapsed by the adjacent-pair dedup.
        // Word emits one logical textbox as a DrawingML mc:Choice + a VML mc:Fallback. The render-time dedup
        // collapses the pair when both land as ADJACENT textbox diffs in ONE paragraph (the common case,
        // fixed). When the two branches land in SEPARATE IR paragraphs/cells (textbox-in-cell), they are not
        // adjacent and the dedup cannot pair them without the reader's MC-preprocessing (WmlComparer's
        // approach) — an engine/reader change outside render scope.
        // ---- M2.4b Workstream C CLOSED WC-1770 via textbox-interior compat coarsening
        // (IrRevisionRenderer.RenderTextboxInnerOp) — now a genuine PASS, no catalog entry. WmlComparer never
        // descends w:txbxContent (it treats w:drawing as one OPAQUE comparison atom, WmlComparer.cs ~L8225/8673),
        // so a changed textbox surfaces as one whole-paragraph del+ins. The IR reader models the textbox interior
        // (for the markdown projection) and its token diff split `In1`→`In` to a lone Deleted `1`. In compatible
        // mode a textbox-interior Modified paragraph now renders as whole-block Deleted (left text) + Inserted
        // (right text), matching the oracle's coarser grain (2 == 2). Validated against WC-1890/2080 (interior
        // token diff already whole-paragraph) and WC-2090/2092 (interior insert/delete) — all keep passing.
        // WC-1900 (WC048-Text-Box-in-Cell): CLOSED in M2.4b Workstream D — now a genuine PASS (IR 6 ==
        // WmlComparer 6). WmlComparer's PreProcessMarkup opens with MarkupCompatibilityProcessMode.ProcessAllParts
        // (Office2007), which MC-RESOLVES each mc:AlternateContent to a single branch and discards the other, so
        // the oracle sees ONE copy of every logical textbox and counts its change once (evidence: the Choice
        // declares Requires="wps", an Office2010 namespace the Office2007 processor cannot satisfy, so the SDK
        // keeps the VML Fallback — either way, ONE branch survives). The IR reader walks BOTH branches (M1.4
        // markdown-projection parity), so a changed textbox renders to two value-equal revision batches. The
        // render-time Choice/Fallback dedup collapsed only the ADJACENT-pair case; WC048's `Textbox3` is a NESTED
        // textbox whose two branches are interleaved with an empty wrapper body ([Textbox3, ⌀, Textbox3, ⌀], not
        // [Textbox3, Textbox3]), so the i/i+1 pair-walk never matched the pair and the duplicate leaked (+2).
        // Fixed by switching the dedup to CONTENT-SIGNATURE OCCURRENCE PARITY (emit odd occurrences, drop even):
        // each AlternateContent body appears an even number of times within a carrier paragraph, so the Fallback
        // copy is dropped wherever it lands. No catalog entry — the row PASSES. (Reader output is unchanged: the
        // fix is render-time/count-only, so the markdown-projection equivalence suite stays green and the markup
        // round-trip path — which keeps both branches because both LEFT and RIGHT carry both — is untouched.)
        // ---- WC-1920 (WC050-Table-in-Text-Box): CLOSED in M2.5 Task 3 — now a genuine PASS (IR 8 == WmlComparer 8).
        // The cell text `This is a test` → `This is a test!` (a `!` appended in a SEPARATE run; the reader's N5
        // run-coalescing already joins them to `test!`). WmlComparer's GetComparisonUnitList groups per-char atoms
        // into words where `!` JOINS the surrounding word (only WordSeparators, CJK, and non-digit-adjacent `.`/`,`
        // are isolated atoms), so it keeps `test!` whole and reports del `test` + ins `test!` (2). The IR's
        // compat common-affix-trim back-off (IrRevisionRenderer.IsWordBoundaryBefore) formerly treated EVERY
        // non-letter-digit as a boundary, so it trimmed the common `test` and reported just `ins !` (1). The
        // boundary test now mirrors GetComparisonUnitList EXACTLY (IsOracleSplitChar): a boundary falls only at a
        // WordSeparator / CJK / non-digit-adjacent `.`/`,`, so `test`/`test!` share no trimmable affix and the
        // whole word del+ins survives. The `.`/`,` isolation (and digit-adjacency carve-out for `3.14`) keeps the
        // `This`/`This.` and `endnote`/`endnote.` trims working — zero scoreboard blast radius (no other row
        // changed). No catalog entry — the row PASSES.

        // ---- M2.4b Workstream C CLOSED WC-1750/1760 (endnote-with-table) — now genuine PASSES, no catalog
        // entry. Two fixes combined: (1) table-aware block similarity + an unambiguous table-residue rule in
        // IrBlockAligner.FillOneGap pair the two endnote tables as Modified (was whole-table del+ins), feeding
        // IrTableDiffer's per-cell diff (Aaa→Aaa1, Eee→Eee1, deleted Ggg/Hhh/Iii row); (2) the empty-mark
